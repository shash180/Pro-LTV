Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for a Business

# Introduction 
The world of business has completely changed and revolves around its customers more than ever. The customer-centric approach is the new norm in todayâ€™s market. The reason for that is the ample choices people have when choosing a product/service.

In this era of businesses fighting against each other to better serve and seize customers from their competitors, the need for them to grow and retain their existing customer base is very important.

But similar to the process of acquiring customers, there is a huge cost associated with the process of retaining existing customers too. (by giving discounts, targeted offers, etc.)

So, you might think, do they need to retain every single customer? Well, not really. In every business, some customers create more value for the business by being a loyal customer and some are just one-time buyers. Identifying such groups of customers and targeting only the high-value customers will help the business to at least sustain in this competitive market.

# What is Customer Value?
Customer value or Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is the total monetary value of transactions/purchases made by a customer with your business over his entire lifetime. Here the lifetime means the time period till your customer purchases with you before moving to your competitors.
